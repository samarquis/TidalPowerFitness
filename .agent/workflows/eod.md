# End of Day Workflow

Use this workflow when you're done working for the day. It will help document your progress and prepare for the next session.

## What This Does
1. Reviews your current TODO.md status
2. Creates/updates a daily progress log
3. Summarizes what was accomplished
4. Notes any blockers or issues
5. Prepares next steps for tomorrow

## How to Use
Simply say: **"I'm done for the day"** or **"End of day"** or use the command `/eod`

The AI will:
- Review your TODO.md and check what's been completed
- Ask you to confirm what you accomplished today
- Document any blockers or issues you encountered
- Update the progress log with today's work
- Suggest what to tackle next session

## What Gets Updated
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Updates the "Active Session", "Master TODO", and "Session History" sections.
- Session summary in the conversation

## Example
```
You: /eod

AI: Let me document your progress for today...

Based on TODO.md, it looks like you:
✅ Fixed workout template loading issue
✅ Added calendar view for classes
⏳ Started work on user dashboard

Any blockers or notes to add?
```
