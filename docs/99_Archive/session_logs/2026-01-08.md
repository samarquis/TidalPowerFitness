# Session Summary - 2026-01-08

## 📝 Summary
Established a robust BMAD-driven session lifecycle management system, including automated context refresh and session conclusion tools.

## 🛠️ Key Changes
- **Enforced BMAD Protocol**: Updated `GEMINI.md` to mandate BMAD methodology for all future interactions.
- **Context Refresh Tool**: Created `scripts/project_status.js` and `status.bat` for high-level project status reports.
- **Todo Tool**: Created `scripts/todo.js` and `todo.bat` for focused task tracking.
- **Session Conclusion Tool**: Created `scripts/conclude_session.js` and `end.bat` to automate progress archiving and history updates.
- **Quick Actions**: Standardized commands (`status`, `todo`, `end session`) for improved agent and user efficiency.

## 🚧 Next Steps
- Address Square Webhook signature verification issue.
- Deploy SR-004 fixes and Trainer Audit features to production.

## 🧠 Context Updates
- Agents should now run `status` or `todo` immediately upon session start to orient themselves.
- The `PROJECT_STATUS.md` is now automatically updated by the `end session` command.
