Site home page:
Item 001- 
![[Pasted image 20260104093537.png]]
the colors for the classes look great but there is black and that does not show up
Item 002 -
- On class page
- ![[Pasted image 20260104093733.png]]
- Need to rethink the layout of the page. This seems a little cumbersome. I do like the All classes layout. I am not sure if there is more to a class but maybe click on the class to get more datails of the class?
Item 003 - Packages
- We do not have Monthly subscriptions for this site 
Item 004 - Light mode
![[Pasted image 20260104094146.png]]
- as you can see this is hard to read

Item 005 - Token display
- can we make this counter look better?

Item 006 - User profile
- We used to have an area that was easy to get to a user profile. I want the user to be able to modify their profile. Change screen name, change any and all profile stuff.
Item 007 - Buttons on forms
- as you can see in the image the buttons dont show up
- ![[Pasted image 20260104094623.png]]
Item 008 - Class schedule
- maybe all pages with the class schedule should open to the All class options
Item 009 - Dashboard
- I like the upcoming class it needs more
	- I want the date of the class to show
- Calendar need to show the classes I am signed up for. 
	- The upcoming class and the calendar should click to each other or hover to see or some indicator

- Item 009 - Leaderboard
	- I need the weights to be listed as numbers. Example would be 1,234,345 or 245,555 not 1234345 or 245555
- Item 010 - Site wide Demo Mode
	- If demo mode is enabled I want to have records that show in all pages. The idea is you generate a bunch of test data for the number of users. They need to have attended random classes and lifted random workouts and weights. This would then generate information for all pages. I need a way for us to see that all pages and options work.
	- If not demo we have just our normal site with real users and real data. I want the demo data to only be visible for scott marquis and lisa 
- Item 011 - Users
	- Lisa Baumgard is missing we need to find her and add her back in to the site. She is the owner of Tidal Power Fitness. so she is a MVP.
- Item 012 - Admin page
	- Not sure if we planned to do a admin dashboard but this page is giving a 404
- Item 013 - workout
	- save or save button not showing a button
	- ![[Pasted image 20260104100525.png]]
- Item 014 - Trainer workflow
	- IMPORTANT REQUIRED
		- I dont see the way a trainer would know to come to the site and add a program to a class? We need to deep dive on this workflow and come up with something that is very intuative and some I could just point a trainer to the site and they would know what to do.
