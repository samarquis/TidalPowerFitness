This is a desktop site review:
Site wide:
- Action items:
	- Change all to icon and not words. Make them consistent site wide
- Nav bar is compressed and is not fitting. It looks terrible.
Home Page
 - Tokens for logged in user is not showing the correct tokens as the site when the user clicks on their name. That site shows I have 8 but the dashboard only has 0.
 - Calendar looks good but it is empty. Is this because I have not signed up for a class? Is this showing my class list? If so need an easy way for the user to know the difference.
 - 
 
Classes
- I am seeing my tokens on this page and at the moment they are correct
- I am not sure on the design. It is hard to see the classes in the cards we have this need to be thought out more thoroughly. I would rather see the classes with a little indicator or something on the days of week available than to see it sorted that way.
Leaderboard
- I want the weight listed with proper format. Thousands, millions with commas as it should be.
- Challenges
- I dont have feed back as there is no data in there
My Program
- I dont have feed back as there is no data in there
My Bookings
- I dont have feed back as there is no data in there
Workouts
- I dont have feed back as there is no data in there
Management
- Do not like the glass feel of the drop down menu
Manage Exercises
- Action items need to be buttons that are consistent on site
Exercise Library
- Need a way to filter by Push or Pull action.
	- Example:
			- Leg Day
				- Push
					- Squats
					- Lunges
Workouts
- no examples on page yet
Assign workout
- This is going to the home dashboard. That is not intended. This should show available classes to assign a workout. 
History
- There is no data to look at
Admin
- 
Business Analytics
- page looks good but no data to fill in
Classes
- Again need to make action items buttons
Trainers
- page looks good
Users
- page looks good
Calendar
- This is a great looking calendar. Is this what is supposed to be site wide? You need to review and see if that is the case.
Reference Data
- Again action items as buttons
Migrations
- admin data only that is good
Change Log
- Not sure if this page is intended to track these kind of issues. I would think we would add a tracking number to all of this and list these fixes on this page. I would think most resent to the top of this list.

Packages
- I know somewhere in the database is more classes. Please review and make sure we have everything listed.
Tokens
- Is this just a little indicator or is this something to click and see?
Cart
- this works at the moment.
