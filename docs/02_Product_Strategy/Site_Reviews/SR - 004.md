#Issue 001
- Users upcoming class should not show item of paste dates. This makes no sense to see an date for a class that is past date. 
#Issue 002
- I don't see a way to toggle my role while logged in. I see the control but it is off the page and I would like a simple way to flip a button to change the feel of the site. I want this to work even if I am not admin. I want a way to be able to flip that option. 
- Example I want to experience the site as a user, or trainer, or admin. I want an easy way for this review / testing. This is only an option for user samarquis4@gmail.com

- On https://tidal-power-frontend.onrender.com/workouts/assign the picklist color is off. The window is white and text is white. Not working at all like that.
- For the All movements should be the first filter. It should only be "Push" or "Pull". Do not need "Legs". That was an example taken out of context.
- EXAMPLE 
	- Push
		- Body Part
			- Legs
				- Squats
#Issue 004
- Looks like we need to fix the exercise database with the Push and Pull exercises.
	- Find a way to identify all the exercises and flag or mark it as either a Push lift or exercise and same thing with the Pull exercises.
