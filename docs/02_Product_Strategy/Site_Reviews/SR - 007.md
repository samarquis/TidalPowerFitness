I think there is a button between the last set and the finish entire work. Is there a button?
Also if the user has completed the exercise loaded pre load the last workout. Example if I preformed the Bench Press and did 10 reps with 135 lbs that should be preloaded in the form.

In this image if we did 3 sets where are the 3 sets. I just see the single set or personal best. Where is the actual workout data for this round?
