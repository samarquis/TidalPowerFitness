Workout template
add exercise needs work
I like the filter by boy part but I need a filter by push  or pull
I need to then pick from the exercises that were filtered and be able to add to the workout. We it is kind of there just dont know that you click something to add to workout. The create workout or whatever button at the bottom does not look like a button.

I really need a better workout class flow. I want the trainer to walk through a wizard of sorts.
I want them to pick a class then assign a workout. If there is not one programmed then build it. I want to then pick the class or pick to assign as template or for the class we just navigated from.

This must be easy and intuative for my users. They need to not have to think of how the site is developed. The just need to work the flow. 

Create or Select class
Program or assign workout
See the class published
See the people signed up for the class

Example workflow

Lisa is getting ready for a Tsunami Strength class
See select the class on Monday. that class opens she can then pick from a predefined work out or create one. If she picks from a created template she needs a pick option to select the workout. If she is programming a workout she need to the form to create a workout. She picks it is a leg day and she picks that it is push day. She is presented with the options of leg and push. She programs that we are doing Squats 3 set of 10 and logs the weight. She picks lunges and 3 sets of 10. She picks Farmers Carry and 3 sets of 10. She also picks ab work. This is 30 sec of dead bug and 30 sec rest. Then plank for 1 minute with 30 second rest. There is a 5 min warm up with 5 minute cool down.
